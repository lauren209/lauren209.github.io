    <h1>Amman</h1>
    <p>For as long as I can remember I've wanted to go to the Middle East. My dad and I flew into Amman and spent one night there before our 
        tour guide would pick us up in the morning and take us to Petra. I wanted to leave the hotel and get a sim card 
        so one of us could have data (if you've ever been to a foreign country and had no data you'll understand why we needed a sim card).
